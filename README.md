## Description
This is a CMS-style blog site where users can create, edit, and delete blog posts, as well as leave comments on existing blog posts. Users can also sign up and log in to access their own dashboard where they can view and edit their own posts.

## Usage
When you visit the site for the first time, you will be presented with the homepage, which includes existing blog posts (if any have been posted), navigation links for the homepage and the dashboard, and the option to log in. If you click on the homepage option, you will be taken to the homepage.

If you click on any other links in the navigation, you will be prompted to either sign up or sign in. If you choose to sign up, you will be prompted to create a username and password. When you click on the sign-up button, your user credentials will be saved and you will be logged into the site.

When you revisit the site at a later time and choose to sign in, you will be prompted to enter your username and password. When you are signed in to the site, you will see navigation links for the homepage, the dashboard, and the option to log out.

If you click on the homepage option in the navigation, you will be taken to the homepage and presented with existing blog posts that include the post title and the date created. If you click on an existing blog post, you will be presented with the post title, contents, post creator’s username, and date created for that post, and have the option to leave a comment. When you enter a comment and click on the submit button while signed in, the comment will be saved and the post will be updated to display the comment, the comment creator’s username, and the date created.

If you click on the dashboard option in the navigation, you will be taken to the dashboard and presented with any blog posts you have already created and the option to add a new blog post. If you click on the button to add a new blog post, you will be prompted to enter both a title and contents for your blog post. When you click on the button to create a new blog post, the title and contents of your post will be saved and you will be taken back to an updated dashboard with your new blog post. If you click on one of your existing posts in the dashboard, you will be able to delete or update your post and taken back to an updated dashboard.

If you click on the logout option in the navigation, you will be signed out of the site. If you are idle on the site for more than a set time, you will be able to view posts and comments but you will be prompted to log in again before you can add, update, or delete posts.
